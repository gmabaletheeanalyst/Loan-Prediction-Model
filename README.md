**Loan Approval Prediction**

**Project Overview**

Loan approval prediction is a classification problem aimed at determining whether a loan application should be approved or rejected.

Traditional manual evaluation by loan officers is often time-consuming, subjective, and prone to bias.

Using machine learning models, the decision-making process can be automated, leading to faster, fairer, and more accurate results.

**Key Influencing Factors:**

Demographic factors: Age, marital status, education, employment

Credit-related factors: Credit score, outstanding debts, repayment history

Financial factors: Monthly income, loan amount, loan term, debt-to-income ratio

Behavioral & socio-economic factors: Housing status, type of employment, lifestyle indicators

**Business Problem**

Manual loan approvals are often biased, inconsistent, and inefficient.

With high volumes of applications, it becomes difficult to process them accurately and fairly.

**Goal:** Build a predictive model that:

Increases efficiency by automating the approval process

Improves accuracy by learning from historical data

Ensures fairness by applying consistent objective rules for all applicants

Scales easily to handle large volumes of loan applications

**Possible Solutions (Machine Learning Models)**

The following models were tested to automate loan approval prediction:

**Model	Description**

Logistic Regression	✅ Good baseline model for classification

Decision Tree	✅ Handles non-linear relationships and provides interpretable rules

Random Forest	✅ Ensemble method that reduces overfitting and improves generalization

**Model Performance**

After training and evaluating the models, the results were as follows:

**Model	Accuracy**

Logistic Regression	92%

Decision Tree	99%

Random Forest	98%
